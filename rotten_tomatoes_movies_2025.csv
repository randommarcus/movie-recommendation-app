Dale Walters is a very charismatic and lighthearted man that works hard to enjoy a life of adventure and excitement. Nigel Loggins is a military veteran that is quiet and calculated in his approach towards life. The film opens with these two men as they are finishing up work. They get called into the office at the end of the day and are laid off by their boss but are told confidently that this is just temporary, and that they will be back at work in three months. Dale and his wife Emily Walters live out in the country on a beautiful property. Emily is the brains of the family and takes great joy in caring for her man-child Dale when she is not playfully sparring with him with her comically sharp wit. They have worked hard and played hard in the past to achieve and maintain the lifestyle of their dreams complete with trips and toys. Emily really wants to have the Walters first child and Dale is struggling with continued joblessness and a lack of maturity. Dale continues to fill his days drinking and distracting himself while Emily continues to work long days at the hospital as a nurse. Nigel meets a contractor named Jedd Wilson who hires him for some casual construction work. Jedd is a very quiet man and does not expose his troubles to many. Nigel is offered a very rare insight into Jedd's life which causes some alarm. Dale and Emily's lifestyle is burning through what money they had put aside. Dale is sinking quickly into a very moody depression while Emily scrambles to adjust to Dale's volatile new temperament. She struggles with the challenge of keeping herself, the property, and Dale together until better days return. Nigel and Dale make regular calls to their old boss Arthur to see if they can be rehired. There are no other jobs to be had, bills are piling up, the stress is escalating, and all hope of life as it was is vanishing. Both men find themselves in a merciless battle against desperation and depression.","[{'Director': 'Candace Gonzalez, \nPaul J. Chinook'}, {'Producer': 'Paul J. Chinook'}, {'Screenwriter': 'Paul J.

It's a fast paced, high-stakes race of epic proportions in which companies compete to blast satellite-carrying rockets into low earth orbit. From exhilarating triumphs to gut-wrenching setbacks, we witness the fierce competition to tackle humanity's next great frontier. However, beneath the shiny veneer of progress is the dark side of capitalism's insatiable appetite for profit and the far-reaching reverberations of a world controlled from the skies. Inspired by the New York Times best-selling book ""When the Heavens Went on Sale"" by esteemed technology and space journalist Ashlee Vance, WILD WILD SPACE follows three rocket and satellite companies -- Astra Space, Rocket Lab, and Planet Labs -- and the quests of their idiosyncratic founders to conquer the burgeoning space industry. Following the roller coaster journey for a piece of this unchartered territory, the film details the multi-faceted uses of satellites, from planet-saving, environmental imaging to ""big brother"" government scrutiny and military espionage, exploring the ethics of technological advances. With billions of dollars at stake, the world's privacy in the balance, and the ramifications of space debris dangerously cluttering earth's low orbit, the documentary reveals how satellites now control the fabric of our modern world, and posits that whoever controls space, may very well control the future of humanity.","[{'Director': 'Ross Kauffman'}, {'Producer': 'Jaye Callahan, \nAshlee Vance, \nAdam McKay, \nTodd Schulman, \nJustin Falvey, \nDarryl Frank, \nChristopher Collins, \nLydia Tenaglia, \nCraig H.

Despite paying a heavy price for his involvements, Havel rises from the ashes to astonishing political heights and becoming the first president of the new Czech Republic. More than a simple biopic, Havel is a deep dive into the inner workings of Havel's psyche and conscience, his doubts and inspirations, his sensitivities and weaknesses. It is infused with his irreverent theatricality, his penchant for the absurd, and his profound understanding of human nature.
